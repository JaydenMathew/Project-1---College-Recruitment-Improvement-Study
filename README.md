# Project-1---College-Recruitment-Improvement-Study

### Purpose: The purpose of this project was to use Python and perform an exploratory data analysis of the CCM Computing Courses Entry Surveys. After thoroughly cleaning the data from this survey, I was to graph and derive insights that can help the Information Technologies department increase enrollment in computing classes. The project was split into the following parts:

### Part 1.  Data Study Questions - Formulate the data study questions that will be answered in the analysis.  There will also be instructor assigned questions that have to be answered.
### Part 2.  Data Exploration and Cleaning - The datasets provided are messy, so after exploring the datasets, first in Excel, I had to bring the dataset into a coding environment, and explore the datasets further to identify what cleaning actions will need to be performed.
### Part 3.  Data Analysis and Visualization - Using the cleaned dataset, I performed an analysis to answer the data science questions.  The answers will then be displayed using plotting techniques.  Next, the project and associated files will be stored on the Project 1 repository on GitHub.
### Part 4.  Improve Plots - I will provide and receive feedback to/from my classmates via a Discussion Forum, and improve my analysis using the feedback. 

### Within this repository, there will be the following files: 

### Project 1 Part 3 Final (1).ipynb : This file is the Juypter Notebook in which all the cleaning, analysis, and visualization was coded. The notebook includes markdown note and commentary that speak to the process of the code and the reasoning behind certain actions. 

### project1_final.csv : This file is the processed and cleaned csv file that was created through the Juypter Notebook data cleaning code that was conducted on the survey data.
